significant setback for baghdadi as she may be used as leverage to negotiate the release of the many prisoners  both foreign iraqi and syrian  that the islamic state is holding\n\nlebanese security officials also hope her capture could be the breakthrough needed to secure the release of at least  lebanese soldiers kidnapped by is and nusra front militants in august\n\na dna test had confirmed the child believed to be nine years old is baghdadis son the lebanese alsafir newspaper said citing security officials\n\nit is believed baghdadis dna may have been taken by us officials during the nine months he was held in an americanrun prison in iraq in  after his capture in fallujah\n\nhowever in a sign of the confusion surrounding the arrests some media sources reported the child in custody was a girl\n\ndulaimi was one of  women released from a syrian government jail in march this year as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of  greek orthodox nuns held by alqaedalinked nusra front in the syrian town of maaloula\n\nsince her release she is believed to have moved around the border area between lebanon and syria sticking mostly to the mountainous territory held by the nusra front said mario abou zeid a research analyst with the carnegie middle east centre in beirut  she was infiltrating the lebanese borders moving inside and outside lebanon with fake ids  in the area controlled by nusra front mr abou zeid said she maintained a very low profile protecting herself and her son  he warned that dulaimis capture while an important step may be of limited value to intelligence services given the islamic state was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle  the main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to  some may think she has all the secrets of baghdadi even though she was captured in the syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from baghdadi on the run along the lebanesesyrian border  it is possible dulaimi had been away from baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to lebanon could have been a defection from baghdadi she could have been fleeing mr abou zeid told fairfax media  she is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the lebanese defence ministry in the yarze district north of beirut the unnamed official said  there is no doubt the counterterrorism operation which involved both lebanese us and european intelligence agencies will prove useful said retired lebanese general and security analyst elias farhat  she is one of the wives of the socalled caliph of the islamic state  she will be useful in the negotiations between the lebanese authorities as is and jabhat alnusra in relation to the kidnapped soldiers general farhat said  her capture is one of the successful outcomes of cooperation between lebanese and western intelligence agencies  but even as news of dulaimis capture broke over lebanon local media reported late on tuesday that militants had attacked a lebanese army patrol in ras

{"claim": "NASA Raises Doubts About Reports of Nicaraguan Meteorite", "perspectives": [{"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video

pregnant after going on a school trip in bosnia\n\nfurious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision when the girls from the town of banja luka returned from a

dropped out of lessons\n\nscroll down for video\n\nthe  schoolgirls were on a trip to the capital of bosnia sarajevo pictured when seven returned pregnant\n\nthe case has provoked nationwide discussions about sex education in bosnia where the number of sexually active girls aged between  and  has increased significantly\n\nsenad mehmedbasic a gynaecologist from sarajevo said that a growing trend for underage pregnancies in bosnia is worrying\n\nthat is the trend of today but we can not continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school he added\n\nhe added that educational institutes and parents should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education\n\nit is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education so they engage in such activities not knowing the consequences\n\nwe have to be more direct in the educational system it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters and that they are later slapped by life\n\nparents of the girls who are from the town of banja luka pictured are demanding to know why the teachers were not providing better supervision on the trip\n\nyoung girls in bosnia are seeking advice from experts online the inserba news network has reported\n\none schoolgirl wrote i would have sex with my boyfriend even though im only  but i am afraid ill be judged\n\nlast year in sarajevo  underage girls became pregnant but seven out of  girls in one five day period has set something of a record\n\nthe national coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici admitted more children in his country are engaging in sexual relations as early as at age of  or \n\nbut he didnt blame the teachers for the school trip

primary school students pregnant after fiveday excursion\n\n\nbih presumably refers to  according to the article  the ministry run by serbias national coordinator for reproductive health nenad babici babici is the only source the article uses for the story\n\nthe original article has now been linked by the new york post  the london daily mail the new york daily news australias courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several others none have performed any followup to confirm the original reporting one newspaper though added details to the story that were never reported\n\nbut were getting ahead of ourselves lets start with the underlying original story\n\neven in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and neerdowells jumping in front of a camera and copious broll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a fiveday trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it\n\nhe said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children\n\nbabic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births\n\nin the republika srpska between  to  percent of people are struggling with infertility we have  percent of miscarriages and between  to  percent premature births he said\n\nonly last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo  minors gave birth four of them are  years old ten are  years old and  are  years old\n\nlook at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were active and about to ovulate eitheror\n\nevery scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage to a linkseeking media searching for a scoop this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article or to stay clear so how did our brethren respond\n\nat the start of the post i mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers magazines and websites as the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news the australian courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and  perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch  the daily mail added details to the story that were never reported", "label": "disagree"}]}

ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na

touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by

unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into

to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an

that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years

input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe

{"claim": "Meteorite leaves crater in Nicaraguan capital Managua", "perspectives": [{"text": "no one was hurt\n\na small meteorite struck a wooded area near the nicaraguan capitals airport on saturday night\n\nresidents reported hearing a loud bang and the crater left by the meteorite measured feet wide and feet bbc reports no one was hurt\n\nastronomer humberto saballos said the meteorite could be part of an asteroid that passed by earth saturday night international experts have been asked to help local scientists in their investigation\n\nbbc", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval sic and heading upwards\n\nit was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife he said\n\nlater that evening the trail had moved two or three inches higher\n\nwhen a concerned dylan fronted up to the doctors they told him it was a small insect bite and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line\n\nlater that morning he awoke to blisters\n\nthats when it became painful it was a searing burn he said\n\nhe finally saw a dermatologist who told him that

himself thus unleashing on the internet that bane of factcheckers the singlesource selfreported uncorroborated implausible story and not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnidbased urban legends that have circulated for more than a century such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin but the reporting agency australian nothern territorys nt news is one akin to americas national enquirer or weekly world news  the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly sensationalized articles such as obama gets croc insurance frog gets struck

living and burrowing under human skin or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible christopher buddle an associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences addressed thomas claim in an email saying that the story didnt wash with what we know about spider behavior\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\nas noted no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered no pictures of the skininvading spider have been presented no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan

rainy november day and the setting in st peters square only burnished francis reputation as a kindly peoples pope the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york times\n\ntheres only one problem apparently none of it ever happened\n\nyes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years ago\n\nthe story was titled somewhat misleadingly paradise for animals the pope doesnt rule it out it wasnt clear which pope the writer meant however\n\nthe next day nov  a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline further the pope and pets paradise is open to all creatures\n\nvecchi faithfully recounted the popes talk about a new creation and also cited paul vis remark\n\nbut the headline put those words in francis mouth and that became the story\n\nthe italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying we will go to heaven with the animals and contending that the pope was quoting st paul  not pope paul  as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog that story by the way is nowhere in the bible\n\nthe urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited st paul as saying that one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ while it has francis adding the phrase paradise is open to all gods creatures\n\nfueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cows milk  and francis said his own mother gave him donkeys milk as a baby\n\nsocial media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the chronology it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis \n show caption\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis\nwhen the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea has never crossed my mind and that depicting the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to me\n\nmaybe hell have to give another

{"claim": "Managua explosion not a meteorite NASA suggests", "perspectives": [{"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion

nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one",

running from his navel to his chest a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day\n\nthomas says that after initially being sent home with antihistamines he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin supposedly they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar according to thomas his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days\n\nits the kind of story that has a lot of people saying nope and a lot of arachnologists saying simply no that didnt happen thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible christopher buddle associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences told us in an email simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\ndr charles e griswold schlinger curator of arachnology emeritus at the california academy of sciences said he couldnt comment on this particular incident but was similarly skeptical in general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that he wrote\n\ncould it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from thomas body maybe but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen buddle told us other arthropods eg ticksmitesperhaps some insects could possibly be associated with something like this perhaps but certainly not a spider\n\nmarie herberstein head of the department of biological sciences at macquarie university in new south wales doesnt fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider though she writes i have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature there are no parasites amongst spiders but she also suspects it may be a different animal she told us my initial reaction is that this

abou zeid said she maintained a very low profile protecting herself and her son  he warned that dulaimis capture while an important step may be of limited value to intelligence services given the islamic state was renowned for ensuring operational matters were never discussed outside a very tight inner circle  the main pillar of their success is to minimise the amount of information anyone can have access to  some may think she has all the secrets of baghdadi even though she was captured in the syrian regime and since her release she has been almost completely cut off from baghdadi on the run along the lebanesesyrian border  it is possible dulaimi had been away from baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to lebanon could have been a defection from baghdadi she could have been fleeing mr abou zeid told fairfax media  she is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the lebanese defence ministry in the yarze

that weve confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event ineter scientist jose millan was quoted by the bbc as saying we have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact\n\naccording to the bbc\n\nthe asteroid was discovered on aug  by the catalina sky survey near tucson ariz and independently detected the next night by the panstarrs  telescope located on the summit of haleakala on maui hawaii according to a nasa statement issued last week\n\nthe statement said that on closest approach the asteroid was to have been onetenth the distance from the center of the earth to the moon or about  miles away", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

sitting on my porch and i saw nothing then all of a sudden i heard a large blast jorge santamaria told the associated press we thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave\n\nthe nicaraguan government has asked for help from international experts including the us geological service to further analyze the event\n\nsee also  stunning new details from the largest asteroid impact in a century", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one",

because we felt an expansive wave\n\na government spokeswoman rosario murillo said a team formed to study the event believed the mdeep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to earth she said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation\n\nthe meteorite may have been a fragment of a housesized asteroid nicknamed pitbull which hurtled past earth on sunday night at a distance of km\n\ndan brown an astronomer at nottingham trent university said that although the nicaraguan impact occurred  hours before pitbull passed earth central america was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid\n\npieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun\n\nit certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom but a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that brown said\n\nhumberto saballos a volcanologist with the nicaraguan institute of territorial studies told the ap it was unclear

and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video\n\nim not frustrated because hes helping a

these individuals all had id on them except for one and that is the one we believed to be banksy edwards said we then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism we also found a passport and id of a paul horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding

group  men total these individuals all had id on them except for one and that is the one we believed to be banksy edwards said we then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism we also found a passport and id of a paul horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding edwards continued horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism conspiracy racketeering and counterfeiting we are also holding the other four individuals whose

post quoted by deepdotweb any organized comcast campaign against users of tor would likely inspire numerous customer complaints not just a few as noted by cato institute research fellow julian sanchez and security researcher robert graham who wrote on twitter\n\n\nthis story is wildly inaccurate comcast spokesperson charlie douglas told ars customers are free to use their xfinity internet service to visit any website or use it however they wish otherwise\n\nwhile comcast publishes an acceptable use policy the company doesnt monitor users browser software or web surfing and has no program addressing the tor browser douglas said\n\nin some previous cases where customers have documented poor customer service comcast has admitted fault and said its customer service agents acted in error in this case comcast says it investigated the story and found no evidence that the encounters ever happened\n\nthe anecdotal chat room evidence provided is not consistent with our agents messages and is not accurate douglas said per our own internal review we have found no evidence that these conversations took place nor do we employ a security assurance team member named kelly we respect customer privacy and security and only investigate and disclose certain information about a customers account with a valid court order or other appropriate legal process\n\ncomcasts jason livingood vp of internet communications and engineering also disputed the report in a blog post today our customers can use tor at any time as i have myself im sure many of them are using it right now he wrote\n\nthe deepdotweb report has other problems it falsely stated that comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws under the six strikes plan comcast customers who are caught by comcast pirating copywritten material are emailed by comcast and told to cease the activity comcast will continue monitoring them and if they violate the six strikes plan five more times their internet service will be terminated\n\nin fact six strikes reports are the result of content companies monitoring online activity and notifying internet service providers of potential violations comcast says it uses email and inbrowser alerts to educate customers about copyright violations but it doesnt cut off service nonetheless the deepdotweb report was credulously rereported by a few other news outlets that didnt seek further confirmation the stories are being shared by twitter users who often add expressions of outrage\n\n\ntor isnt for criminals\n\ntor project executive director andrew lewman told ars that it doesnt have enough information on the comcast rumors to know whether this is a companywide practice he noted that people with uncensored connections to the internet can use tor to share their access with human rights defenders and journalists behind national firewalls we tend to have good relationships with internet service providers in free societies for this reason\n\ntor itself was unfairly branded the web browser for criminals by one news report\n\n\nenlarge\nbusiness insider\nwhile tor can be used by criminals it was created by the us naval research laboratory to protect government communications and is used by many people with privacy concerns including activists in countries with repressive governments for anyone hoping to use tor to mask downloads of pirated material the tor project itself says that file sharing peertopeerpp is widely unwanted in the tor network and exit nodes are configured to block file sharing traffic by default comcast was caught interfering with bittorrent traffic in \n\nif the customers described by deepdotweb did have discussions with comcast employees its possible they were being notified of a pending legal action deepdotweb quoted comcast as saying if were asked by a court to provide customer information then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away\n\ndouglas told ars that its impossible to speculate whether thats what happened in this case since the reports mentioned no specific customers\n\nif any ars readers are subscribers of comcast and use the tor browser wed love to hear about your experiences in the comments", "label": "disagree"}]}

original article has now been linked by the new york post  the london daily mail the new york daily news australias courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several others none have performed any followup to confirm the original reporting one newspaper though added details to the story that were never reported\n\nbut were getting ahead of ourselves lets start with the underlying original story\n\neven in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and neerdowells jumping in front of a camera and copious broll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a fiveday trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it\n\nhe said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children\n\nbabic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births\n\nin the republika srpska between  to  percent of people are struggling with infertility we have  percent of miscarriages and between  to  percent premature births he said\n\nonly last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo  minors gave birth four of them are  years old ten are  years old and  are  years old\n\nlook at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were active and about to ovulate eitheror\n\nevery scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage to a linkseeking media searching for a scoop this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article or to stay clear so how did our brethren respond\n\nat the start of the post i mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers

sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to

at  pm ct on saturday aug  precisely the time police say brown was shot\n\na glide user living nearby whose identity is being protected was simply using the glide app on their smartphone exactly as it was designed  to instantly communicate with a friend through our realtime video texting service simultaneously they also captured audio in the background of the gunshots allegedly fired at michael

but instead of alcohol the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck apparently moved by the selfless act lin confronts thomas and tells him that hes being filmed\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nas of tuesday morning the video had racked up more than  million views on youtube and inspired more than  glowing news articles from around the world following its success lin launched an indiegogo fundraising campaign to help thomas get a fresh start which has netted more than  in wellmeaning donations from the public\n\nbut now a nursing student from anaheim has come forward to say theres no way thomas could have been secretly filmedbecause he and lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car the whole thing is bullshit says taugan tan kadalim who claims that on dec  he was outside the euclid liquor  market where the videos pivotal scene is set thomas knew he was being followed\n\nthe yearold says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lins car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video kadalim decided to stick around and watch\n\nwhat kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by lins car eventually the prankster returned to his car and a few minutes later thomas wandered into the liquor store several calls to euclid liquor  market to confirm kadalims account went unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into some famous youtube star while buying a lotto ticket she tells vocativ don couldnt wait to watch the video\n\nbut when kadalim did see the video released on dec  he was floored\n\nbro he drove thomas to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video\n\nim not frustrated because hes helping a homeless man and people love this video he says im frustrated because its dishonest and exploitive\n\nprior to kadalims revelation lin told vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted there is no way were making any of this up he said this is real\n\nsubsequent attempts to reach lin for further comment on kadalims accusations were unsuccessful\n\nafter the video went viral lin told us previously that he plucked thomas from the homeless shelter where hed been staying and put him up in a hotel the name of which lin would not disclose lin has also refused all media requests to speak with thomas and he denied repeated requests from vocativ to make thomas available for an interview at the same time hes been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man including this xmas surprise makeover released sunday\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nlin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works in which he plans to surprise thomas with all of

mite there are a few different parasitic mites out there which can sometimes look a bit like a spider i cant think of any spider which could do this to a person\ndr mark harvey from the western australian museum agreed and said he found the case bizarre\ni must confess i was amazed because ive never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human or indeed any mammal he said\nspiders need air to breathe they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs being under the skin of somebody i would have thought they wouldnt have enough air to survive\neven if it was a mite ive never seen anything like this even if it was an insect ive never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this so it really is a remarkable case\ndr harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends\nwe hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin then the baby spiders burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics he said\nnone of those are true theyre just made up stories\ntheyre not actually able to dig through the skin thats why this case is so unusual some can burrow into soil but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that\nsomething which is true according to dr harvey is that certain arachnids do live on humans\nwe all have mites living on our faces theyre follicle mites but theyre absolutely miniscule and you cant see them we transmit them to our children when we have kids he said\nthey live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin those mites are so small you cant see them and theyre not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach\ndr framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender dead or alive and enlisting the help of experts\nit would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it he said\nif you have been bitten by something the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for

roulette\n\nmeteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past most notably in the february   chelyabinsk impact which damaged buildings across central russia see chelyabinsk meteor the animated movie\n\nthat meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of  rc exploding in the atmosphere above russia with about  kilotons of energy bright enough to sunburn some watchers a larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the southern hemisphere on the same date\n\nupdate in a late monday report on rc  astronomers at nasas nearearth object program based at the jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena california revised size estimates for the asteroid radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about  feet  meters across and rotates rapidly several times a minute that makes it roughly half the size of the  russian meteorite\n\nthe nasa update also called the meteorite report from managua unrelated to rc  citing the hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion as yet no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size

could be part of an asteroid that passed by earth saturday night international experts have been asked to help local scientists in their investigation\n\nbbc", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

{"claim": "Nasa questions whether crater in Nicaragua caused by meteorite", "perspectives": [{"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video

{"claim": "Explosion reported near the Nicaraguan capital attributed to meteorite impact but experts including NASA cast doubt on claims", "perspectives": [{"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "agree"},

but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a fiveday trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it\n\nhe said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children\n\nbabic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births\n\nin the republika srpska between  to  percent of people are struggling with infertility we have  percent of miscarriages and between  to  percent premature births he said\n\nonly last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo  minors gave birth four of them are  years old ten are  years old and  are  years old\n\nlook at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were

century such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin but the reporting agency australian nothern territorys nt news is one akin to americas national enquirer or weekly world news  the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly sensationalized articles such as obama gets croc insurance frog gets struck down by lightning and best man left bleeding after being hit in eye by

that such an occurrence is possible christopher buddle an associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences addressed thomas claim in an email saying that the story didnt wash with what we know about spider behavior\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\nas noted no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered no pictures of the skininvading spider have been presented no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan thomas himself have been referenced\n\nperhaps theres a germ of truth to

contact sally morrow\n\nit was a sparkling moment on a rainy november day and the setting in st peters square only burnished francis reputation as a kindly peoples pope the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york times\n\ntheres only one problem apparently none of it ever happened\n\nyes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years ago\n\nthe story was titled somewhat misleadingly paradise for animals the pope doesnt rule it out it wasnt clear which pope the writer meant however\n\nthe next day nov  a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline further the pope and pets paradise is open to all creatures\n\nvecchi faithfully recounted the popes talk about a new creation and also cited paul vis remark\n\nbut the headline put those words in francis mouth and that became the story\n\nthe italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying we will go to heaven with the animals and contending that the pope was quoting st paul  not pope paul  as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog that story by the way is nowhere in the bible\n\nthe urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited st paul as saying that one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ while it has francis adding the phrase paradise is open to all gods creatures\n\nfueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cows milk  and francis said his own mother gave him donkeys milk as a baby\n\nsocial media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the chronology it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis \n show caption\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis\nwhen the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea has never crossed my mind and that depicting the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to me\n\nmaybe hell have to give another interview to deflate this latest story and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise\n\nkre end gibson", "label": "disagree"}]}

the dead poet was on vacation in bali and woke up one morning to discover a red trail of irritation running from his navel to his chest a trail that continued to grow longer throughout the day\n\nthomas says that after initially being sent home with antihistamines he returned to the medical center where doctors discovered a tiny tropical spider beneath his skin supposedly they removed the creature through an incision and placed it in a specimen jar according to thomas his doctors speculated that it had entered his skin through an appendectomy scar and just kept moving up his body thomas told various news outlets that he believes the spider was there for three days\n\nits the kind of story that has a lot of people saying nope and a lot of arachnologists saying simply no that didnt happen thomas may have been told that a spider invaded his flesh but the arachnologists we spoke to about this story sincerely doubt that one actually did\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible christopher buddle associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences told us in an email simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\ndr charles e griswold schlinger curator of arachnology emeritus at the california academy of sciences said he couldnt comment on this particular incident but was similarly skeptical in general this is impossible and there is no reason that a spider would do that he wrote\n\ncould it be that doctors pulled something other than a spider from thomas body maybe but we should wait to hear if more information comes out about the specimen buddle told us other arthropods eg ticksmitesperhaps some insects could possibly be associated with something like this perhaps but certainly not a spider\n\nmarie herberstein head of the department of biological sciences at macquarie university in new south wales doesnt fully exclude the possibility that this could be a spider though she writes i have never heard of any spider to crawl or exist under the skin or integument of any other creature there are no parasites amongst spiders but she also suspects it may be a different animal she told us my initial reaction is that this is a mite also legged rather than a spider and mites are renowned for this type of

circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video

then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it thomas walks right into a liquor store but instead of alcohol the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck apparently moved by the selfless act lin confronts thomas and tells him that hes being filmed\n\nuploaded by

an indiegogo fundraising campaign to help thomas get a fresh start which has netted more than  in wellmeaning donations from the public\n\nbut now a nursing student from anaheim has come forward to say theres no way thomas could have been secretly filmedbecause he and lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car the whole thing is bullshit says taugan tan kadalim who claims that on dec  he was outside the euclid liquor  market where the videos pivotal scene is set thomas knew he was being followed\n\nthe yearold says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lins car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video kadalim decided to stick around and watch\n\nwhat kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by lins car eventually the prankster returned to his car and a few minutes later thomas wandered into the liquor store several calls to euclid liquor  market to confirm kadalims account went unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into some famous youtube star while buying a lotto ticket she tells vocativ don couldnt wait to watch the video\n\nbut when kadalim did see the video released on dec  he was floored\n\nbro he drove thomas to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video\n\nim not frustrated because hes helping a homeless man and people love this video he says im frustrated because its dishonest and exploitive\n\nprior to kadalims revelation lin told vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted there is no way were making any of this up he said this is real\n\nsubsequent attempts to reach lin for further comment on kadalims accusations were unsuccessful\n\nafter the video went viral lin told us previously that he plucked thomas from the homeless shelter where hed been staying and put him up in a hotel the name of which lin would not disclose lin has also refused all media requests to speak with thomas and he denied repeated requests from vocativ to make thomas available for an interview at the same time hes been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man including this xmas surprise makeover released sunday\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nlin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works in which he plans to surprise thomas with all of the money thats been raised for him on indiegogo asked how the public could be certain

holiday in bali ohhhh my gawwd\n\norigins on  october  social media lit up with a seemingly implausible tale an australian man named dylan thomas quickly became the subject of international buzz via facebook after he asserted that during his vacation trip to bali a spider burrowed under his skin and had to be surgically removed thomas frightening spider story was picked up by news outlets in australia then europe and eventually in the us images sourced from thomas facebook circulated as well via news outlets on twitter and facebook\n\nspider burrows through mans appendix scar and crawls

pulled out of his stomach\n\nyearold dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval sic and heading upwards\n\nit was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife he said\n\nlater that evening the trail had moved two or three inches higher\n\nwhen a concerned dylan fronted up to the doctors they told him it was a small insect bite and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line\n\nlater that morning he awoke to blisters\n\nthats when it became painful it was a searing burn he said\n\nhe finally saw a dermatologist who told him that it was something out of the ordinary\n\ndoctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from dylans recent appendix removal\n\nthe doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing\n\ndylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days\n\nmoreover all the information contained in that article came from thomas himself thus unleashing on the internet that bane of factcheckers the singlesource selfreported uncorroborated implausible story and not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnidbased urban legends that have circulated for more than a century such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin but the reporting agency australian nothern territorys nt news is one akin to americas national enquirer or weekly world news  the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly sensationalized articles such as obama gets croc insurance frog gets struck down by lightning and best man left bleeding after being hit in eye by flying dildo the story has since been published by more staid news sources as well\n\nweve found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible christopher buddle an associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences addressed thomas claim in an email saying that the story didnt wash with what we know about spider behavior\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\nas noted no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered no pictures of the skininvading spider have been presented no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan thomas himself have been referenced\n\nperhaps theres a germ of truth to this story that has been distorted through misdiagnosis or misunderstanding but in the

years on the run\n\nwe had a hour antigraffiti task force monitoring different groups where banksy was known to frequent we received word that around am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of bankys art studios this group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred we then arrested the group  men total these individuals all had id on them except for one and that is the one we believed to be banksy edwards said we then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism we also found a passport and id of a paul horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding edwards continued horner is currently being held without bail on

capital over the weekend but luckily no one was hurt a small meteor thought to have broken off from an earthpassing asteroid left a footwide crater\n\nthe meteorite  which experts say may have disintegrated on impact  smashed through a wooded area outside the airport in managua leaving a footdeep hole\n\nwe thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave jorge santamaria a resident in the area of the impact was quoted by the associated press as saying\n\nthe ap quotes nicaraguan government spokeswoman rosario murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to earth\n\nnicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened the ap says\n\nall the evidence that weve confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event ineter scientist jose millan was quoted by the bbc as saying we have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact\n\naccording to the bbc\n\nthe asteroid was discovered on aug  by the catalina sky survey near tucson ariz and independently detected the next night by the panstarrs  telescope located on the summit of haleakala on maui hawaii according to a nasa statement issued last week\n\nthe statement said that on closest approach the asteroid was to have been onetenth the distance from the center of the earth to the moon or about  miles away", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

to find out more about what happened the daily telegraph said", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video

peoples pope the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york times\n\ntheres only one problem apparently none of it ever happened\n\nyes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years ago\n\nthe story was titled somewhat misleadingly paradise for animals the pope doesnt rule it out it wasnt clear which pope the writer meant however\n\nthe next day nov  a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline further the pope and pets paradise is open to all creatures\n\nvecchi faithfully recounted the popes talk about a new creation and also cited paul vis remark\n\nbut the headline put those words in francis mouth and that became the story\n\nthe italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying we will go to heaven with the animals and contending that the pope was quoting st paul  not pope paul  as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog that story by the way is nowhere in the bible\n\nthe urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited st paul as saying that one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ while it has francis adding the phrase paradise is open to all gods creatures\n\nfueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cows milk  and francis said his own mother gave him donkeys milk as a baby\n\nsocial media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the chronology it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis \n show caption\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis\nwhen the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea has never crossed my mind and that depicting the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to me\n\nmaybe hell have to give another interview to deflate this latest story and to offer his real thoughts on pets and paradise\n\nkre end gibson", "label":

meteorite plummeting to earth creating a footwide crater\n\na piece of the  rc asteroid that passed close to earth on sunday the meteorite dug a footdeep hole nicaraguan government scientists said miraculously no one was hurt\n\nthe footwide asteroid was passing  miles from earth on sunday but posed no danger to the planet nasa said\n\nauthorities have yet to determine whether the meteorite is buried or whether it disintegrated when it hit the ground at first locals believed the blast was caused by an earthquake a regular occurrence in the country reuters said\n\nall the evidence that weve confirmed onsite corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event said jose millan of the nicaraguan institute of earth studies\n\nthe explosion on the outskirts of managua near the citys airport took place at around  pm and left a crater the size of a house\n\nit could have come off that asteroid because it is normal for that to occur we have to study it more because it could be ice or rock said humberto garcia a nicaraguan volcanologist\n\ncalling it a fascinating event nicaraguas first lady rosario murillo said the country would work with the us geological service to find out more about what happened the daily telegraph said", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

piece under the sensational headline\n\nbih seven primary school students pregnant after fiveday excursion\n\n\nbih presumably refers to  according to the article  the ministry run by serbias national coordinator for reproductive health nenad babici babici is the only source the article uses for the story\n\nthe original article has now been linked by the new york post  the london daily mail the new york daily news australias courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several others none have performed any followup to confirm the original reporting one newspaper though added details to the story that were never reported\n\nbut were getting ahead of ourselves lets start with the underlying original story\n\neven in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and neerdowells jumping in front of a camera and copious broll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a fiveday trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it\n\nhe said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children\n\nbabic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births\n\nin the republika srpska between  to  percent of people are struggling with infertility we have  percent of miscarriages and between  to  percent premature births he said\n\nonly last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo  minors gave birth four of them are  years old ten are  years old and  are  years old\n\nlook at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were active and about to ovulate eitheror\n\nevery scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage to a linkseeking media searching for a scoop this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article or to stay clear so how did our brethren respond\n\nat the start of the post i mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers magazines and websites as the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news the australian courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and  perhaps representing the worst offense of the bunch  the daily mail added details to the story that were never reported", "label": "disagree"}]}

homeless man named thomas  and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it thomas walks right into a liquor store but instead of alcohol the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck apparently moved by the selfless act lin confronts thomas and tells him that hes being filmed\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nas of tuesday morning the video had racked up more than  million views on youtube and inspired more than  glowing news articles from around the world following its success lin launched an indiegogo fundraising campaign to help thomas get a fresh start which has netted more than  in wellmeaning donations from the public\n\nbut now a nursing student from anaheim has come forward to say theres no way thomas could have been secretly filmedbecause he and lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car the whole thing is bullshit says taugan tan

lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lins car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a

who have been touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by lins car eventually the prankster returned to his car and a few minutes later thomas wandered into the liquor store several calls to euclid liquor  market to confirm kadalims account went unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into some famous youtube star while buying a lotto ticket she tells vocativ don couldnt wait to watch the video\n\nbut when kadalim did see the video released on dec  he was floored\n\nbro he drove thomas to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video\n\nim not frustrated because hes helping a homeless man and people love this video he says im frustrated because its dishonest

attempts to reach lin for further comment on kadalims accusations were unsuccessful\n\nafter the video went viral lin told us previously that he plucked thomas from the homeless shelter where hed been staying and put him up in a hotel the name of which lin would not disclose lin has also refused all media requests to speak with thomas and he denied repeated requests from vocativ to make thomas available for an interview at the same time hes been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man including this xmas surprise makeover released sunday\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nlin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works in which he plans to surprise thomas with all of the money thats been raised for him on indiegogo asked how the public could be

hour antigraffiti task force monitoring different groups where banksy was known to frequent we received word that around am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of bankys art studios this group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred we then arrested the group  men total these individuals all had id on them except for one and that is the one we believed to be banksy edwards said we then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism we also found a passport and id of a paul horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding edwards continued horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism conspiracy racketeering and counterfeiting we are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time\n\nhorner was arrested by london police in watford a town and borough in hertfordshire england about  miles northwest of central london\n\nthe graffiti artist that goes by the name space invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of banksys identity\n\nhes just doing art spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how that is what he was doing and i hope that is what hell continue to do invader said for the london police to setup some hour task force just to catch banksy is ridiculous i hope we hear plenty of noise from the good taxpaying citizens of london about this\n\nafter todays arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with banksys arrest cnn spoke with john hawes who is a project manager for banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also\n\nif they spent this many manhours and brought this many charges against banksy i cant imagine that hell be the only one to go down in all of this hawes said all the beauty paul horner brought to this world unfortunately the london police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up its such a shame\n\nbanksys identity was long speculated to be robin gunningham a man born in bristol england in  known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces he does not sell his work directly however art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder\n\npolice apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a christian organization named fappy the antimasturbation dolphin\n\nim just happy to be a part of this whole thing fappy told cnn im not familiar with this banksy character honestly if its not in the bible i probably havent heard of it but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of selfrape then that is a good thing hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the devils doorbell hopefully god willing one day masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the devils playground\n\nlocal resident year old matthew williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest\n\nwhat a waste of taxpayers money wouldnt it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence  what harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork the counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash williams continued this is just another move by the fiveoh to crush anything good and free people need to work out what side theyre on and if theyre on the side of beauty and freedom they need to start fighting back there are simply not enough heroes like banksy to do it for you i hope this blows up in the cops faces and the rest of the government as well\n\npeople are taking the piss out of you everyday they butt into your life take a cheap shot at you and then disappear they leer at you from tall buildings and make you feel small they make flippant comments from buses that imply youre not sexy enough and that all the fun is happening somewhere else they are on tv making your

"label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one",

{"claim": "Fidel Castro Dead Yes He Is But The Cuban Leader Is Alive Death Rumors Proven False", "perspectives": [{"text": "miami  the bulletin now falls squarely in the pantheon of unconfirmed phenomena along with ufos sightings of the loch ness monster and the breakup of brad pitt and angelina jolie\n\nfidel castro is dead\n\nsooner or later it will be true but on friday for the umpteenth time miami was distracted by the rumor that mr castro  who has survived revolution assassination attempts countless cigars substantial stress a fall after leaving a stage and a lifethreatening stomach ailment had finally succumbed\n\nhope springs eternal said james cason the former head of the united states interests section in cuba from  to  and now the mayor of coral gables a wealthy enclave in miamidade county he must have died  times since the time i went to cuba\n\ncubanamericans gathered in the usual spot the versailles restaurant on calle ocho and other cuban establishments to ponder the possibility that this time maybe maybe it would be true but even here in a city still fixated by mr castro rumor fatigue was obvious versailles had put its fidelisdead game plan into action  assigning some parking spots to local tv and radio stations but few showed up\n\nit was no different at la carreta a restaurant in westchester fla a cubanamerican stronghold\n\nthere is always doubt about this the joke is on us said manolo alvarez  a retired painter laughing as he held court with his friends in front of the cuban cafecito counter but eventually it will happen no one is immortal and he will join the devil\n\ncastro death alerts come fast and frequently these days his age ill health long absence from public view and societys shift from oldschool rumor mill to hyperspeed twitter feed make even debunked stories effortlessly spreadable in fact determining the provenance of each rumor has become a kind of modernday parlor game\n\nin this case the story probably stemmed from a simple mixup the death of a lesserknown namesake in a faraway country fidel castro odinga the son of a prominent kenyan politician raila odinga died on sunday and was eulogized on thursday a similar mistake occurred in august  when a cuban revolutionary figure rene orley sanchez castro died in cuba spawning a swirl of speculation around the world\n\nlike most of the past false reports the one on friday was bolstered by tantalizing circumstantial droplets the last time mr castro was seen in public was jan   making friday the first anniversary of his disappearance and mr castro never at a loss for words had failed to comment about decembers announcements by his younger brother ral and president obama that the united states and cuba would resume diplomatic ties\n\nthere was also word on friday of an abruptly scheduled news conference and chatter  true or not  about how the major roads to a famous revolutionary cemetery in santiago de cuba where mr castro reportedly will be buried were being repaired\n\nthe likeliest explanation for mr castros absence is that he is in fact too mentally and physically frail to be seen or to speak\n\nwe dont know what his physical state is because they never let you know mr cason said of cuban officials but they want him to be remembered as strong and vigorous they dont want him to be seen\n\ntales of mr castros demise have surfaced for decades in  the state department had to beat back a flurry of reports and questions from miami about mr castros apparent death the sources of the speculation were varied and dubious a ham radio operator in havana a nurse in cuba who telephoned a friend in miami a report by an astrologer\n\nmore rumors followed off and on and then accelerated after mr castro vanished for a stretch in  and once again after he relinquished power to his brother ral in  through the years mr castro has been rumored to have been stricken by heart attacks brain hemorrhages strokes and cancer he has alternately delighted in and derided the many attempts to kill him off early as he joked once in \n\nnow that our enemies have prematurely declared me dying or dead i am happy to send my compatriots and friends around the world this short film material mr castro said in  after his absence\n\nin miami his death when it is finally confirmed will be historically momentous and for most cause for jubilation the city will dust off its everevolving contingency plans even some private schools have early dismissal emails to parents at the ready\n\nbut to a certain extent mr castros death will also be anticlimactic years ago his death was seen as the necessary prelude to a democratic cuba and a return home for tens of thousands of exiles with ral castro firmly in place that is no longer the case\n\nif this had happened at the height of his power or even when he was just fading it would be different said peter hakim a cuba expert at the interamerican dialogue center in washington this was almost a personal battle not to let fidel win now i think people are beginning to accept that fidel has won he will go to his grave with the government intact and the us backing down from its unalterable commitment to unseat the regime he installed", "label": "agree"}]}

hunter spoke the texas department of public safety wrote state legislators saying in an oct   email it does not have any information to confirm statements about islamic terrorists or isis fighters

judicial watch a conservative news website stating islamic terrorists had entered the country from mexico according to unidentified homeland security sources judicial watch said four terrorists had been apprehended in the previous  hours by federal authorities and the dps in mcallen and pharr\n\nin the message to legislators bodisch further wrote an unsecure border is certainly a vulnerability that can be exploited by criminals of all kinds and it would be nave to rule out the possibility that any criminal organization would not look for opportunities to take advantage of security gaps along our international border that said dps does not have any information to confirm the specific statements recently reported in the press\n\non sept   politifact in washington analyzed an august

director of the center for the study of terrorist radicalization at the foundation for defense of democracies in washington\n\ngartensteinross said by phone he knows of no reporting coming through dhs suggesting that a large number of isis fighters have been intercepted at the border ive talked to a large number of people within the department and the department has unequivocally denied it theres not one shred of evidence this is the case\n\nkasper informed wed not confirmed hunters statement said hunter stands by what he said\n\nkasper also expressed doubt federal agencies are revealing the

stephen a smith the lead produced some exclusive details about coverage plans for monday night football  namely the network would be having a domestic violence panel featuring  different voices  all men  our bold emphasis has been added\n\non monday night a panel on a twohour pregame show for monday night football will among other things address domestic abuse this panel will discuss once again the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman\nthe panel for that discussion will include the following people chris berman cris carter mike ditka adam schefter tom jackson keyshawn johnson jon gruden mike tirico stuart scott steve young and ray lewis\n\nup to  men all between the ages of  and  will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on espn zero women victims of domestic violence in america are most likely to be women aged \n\nwhen the show has updates from the fieldbrief reports about injuries and the upcoming gametheyll cut to female sideline reporters lisa salters and on some weeks suzy kolber\n\nthese people are not allowed at the table\n\nhow collins got that information whether through his own sources or espn itself was never shared with esquire readers  nevertheless the  men theme kept coming back throughout his piece as a tentpole of outrage\n\nthe existence of espns  men domestic violence panel and the anger towards it spread slowly throughout the weekend  deadspin has a nice recap of how far the story reached as it was noticed on twitter and reblogged across the internet with one feminist organization even putting the network on blast based on the esquire article in a press release\n\nof course espn is not having an  man domestic violence panel tonight  the network has explicitly and publicly called the esquire story false as documented below\n\nbut just examining this story from the outset there was plenty to be skeptical about in esquires story\n\nfirst of all espn has covered domestic violence and the nfl at length while involving women in the discussion  jane mcmanus has been a consistent presence on espn airwaves and espn has a deep bench of female commentators that have talked about the issue on the air  you can criticize sports networks for not involving women in more prominent ways but espn at least appears to be trying to make an effort here  mcmanus defended the network on twitter\n\n\n\nsecond in light of those tweets theres no mention of suzy kolber  who will be one of the hosts on monday night countdown tonight  if theres any panel discussion happening tonight wouldnt she be involved\n\nthird its easy to make fun of espn and the gratuitously absurd amount of nfl analysts the network employs  but who in their right mind would conduct an  person panel on a topic like domestic violence  thats not something that even nancy grace and the cable news networks would be silly enough to do\n\nif were to believe this esquire story chris berman would be moderating an  person panel discussion on domestic violence including everyone from the game announcers to reporters  its nonsensical  not even espn would be that dense\n\nbristol began the counteroffensive today  the network released their coverage plans for monday night countdown tonight  and in a move straight out of the espn pr playbook they also highlighted womens contributions to their coverage of the nfl domestic violence crisis\n\na rare public statement from john wildhack one of the highest on the espn executive food chain also disputed the esquire reportcolumnrantguesswork\n\ncontrary to published reports in esquire there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonights monday night countdown  we will present our normal monday night football pregame show with suzy kolber hosting  espn is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence and is committed to continued coverage  much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnw platforms  including hannah storm jemele hill jane mcmanus kate fagan sarah spain and more \n\nso how did this happen  its simple  haphazard and reckless writing at esquire gradually began to be taken as fact\n\nthere never were plans for an  men panel to discuss domestic violence on monday night countdown  collins merely listed the talent that would be working the show and assumed the topic would come up at some point during the evening in an unbelievable failure in communication through the written word\n\ncollins explained his position in greater detail on his twitter page\n\n\nthats a pretty far cry from what collins actually wrote in his article which made it abundantly clear there would be a special domestic violence panel with enough men to field an entire football team up to  men all between the ages of  and  will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on espn  theres no ambiguity in that statement\n\n out of  people would read that sentence and think espn would be televising a large allmale panel discussion specifically focused on domestic violence tonight  how does someone who is a news editor at a major publication blur the lines of truth and fiction so badly\n\n\n\n\nhad collins stuck with that last tweet he would have had the basis for a decent column and a valid criticism worth raising  but because of the overall sloppiness of the esquire piece that point was missed entirely  instead a lot of people have wasted a lot of time talking about an  men domestic violence panel that never existed", "label": "disagree"}]}

believed to be a tropical spider\n\nbut it seems we may have all been caught in a web of misinformation\n\narachnologist dr volker framenau said whatever the creature was it was almost impossible for the culprit to have been a spider\n\nif you look at a spider the fangs the mouth parts they have they are not able to burrow they cant get through skin he said\n\nwe thought it may have been something like a mite there are a few different parasitic mites out there which can sometimes look a bit like a spider i cant think of any spider which could do this to a person\n\ndr mark harvey from the western australian museum agreed and said he found the case bizarre\n\ni must confess i was amazed because ive never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human or indeed any mammal he said\n\nspiders need air to breathe they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs being under the skin of somebody i would have thought they wouldnt have enough air to survive\n\neven if it was a mite ive never seen anything like this even if it was an insect ive never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this so it really is a remarkable case\n\ndr harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends\nwe hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin then the baby spiders burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics he said\n\nnone of those are true theyre just made up stories\n\ntheyre not actually able to dig through the skin thats why this case is so unusual some can burrow into soil but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that\n\nsomething which is true according to dr harvey is that certain arachnids do live on humans\n\nwe all have mites living on our faces theyre follicle mites but theyre absolutely miniscule and you cant see them we transmit them to our children when we have kids he said\n\nthey live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin those mites are so small you cant see them and theyre not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach\n\ndr framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender dead or alive and enlisting the help of experts\n\nit would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it he said\n\nif you have been bitten by something the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral\n\ndylan thomas has been contacted for comment\n\n wa today", "label": "disagree"}]}

after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval sic and heading upwards\n\nit was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a

himself thus unleashing on the internet that bane of factcheckers the singlesource selfreported uncorroborated implausible story and not only was that story reminiscent of several other familiar arachnidbased urban legends that have circulated for more than a century such as those about spiders living or laying eggs under human skin but the reporting agency australian nothern territorys nt news is one akin to americas national enquirer or weekly world news  the online version of a tabloid that publishes silly sensationalized articles such as obama gets croc insurance frog gets struck down by lightning and best man left bleeding after being hit in eye by flying dildo the story has since been published by more staid news sources as well\n\nweve found no documented cases of spiders living and burrowing under human skin or even any information suggesting that such an occurrence is possible christopher buddle an associate professor at mcgill universitys department of natural resource sciences addressed thomas claim in an email saying that the story didnt wash with what we know about spider behavior\n\ni think this is extremely suspect unusual and likely not possible simply put it is not plausible and i can think of no valid reason why a spider might crawl beneath skin through a scar the claim that it was feeding and moving up through the scar tissue defies logic and defies what we know about the biology of spiders i am also sceptical because the evidence the spider itself is not presented\n\nas noted no corroborating information about this alleged medical case has been offered no pictures of the skininvading spider have been presented no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan

california man has come forward to claim that the internet prankster behind it faked a significant portion of the film confirming our earlier suspicions\n\nin the video released last week youtube star josh paler lin purports to give a homeless man named thomas  and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it thomas walks right into a liquor store but instead of alcohol the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck apparently moved by the selfless act lin confronts thomas and tells him that hes being filmed\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nas of tuesday morning the video had racked up more than  million views on youtube and inspired more than  glowing news articles from around the world following its success lin launched an indiegogo fundraising campaign to help thomas get a fresh start which has netted more than  in wellmeaning donations from the public\n\nbut now a nursing student from anaheim has come forward to say theres no way thomas could have been secretly filmedbecause he and lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car the whole thing is bullshit says taugan tan kadalim who claims that on dec  he was outside the euclid liquor  market where the videos pivotal scene is set thomas knew he was being followed\n\nthe yearold says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lins car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video kadalim decided to stick around and watch\n\nwhat kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by lins car eventually the prankster returned to his car and a few minutes later thomas wandered into the liquor store several calls to euclid liquor  market to confirm kadalims account went unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into some famous youtube star while buying a lotto ticket she tells vocativ don couldnt wait to watch the video\n\nbut when kadalim did see the video released on dec  he was floored\n\nbro he drove thomas to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however

is possible dulaimi had been away from baghdadi for so long that her information may be of little worth and her decision to relocate to lebanon could have been a defection from baghdadi she could have been fleeing mr abou zeid told fairfax media  she is being questioned by investigators at the headquarters of the lebanese defence ministry in the yarze district north of beirut the unnamed official

what can happen with hijacked planes\n\nthe official said the aircraft are a serious counterterrorism concern because reports of terrorist control over the libyan airliners come three weeks before the th anniversary of  attacks and the second anniversary of the libyan terrorist attack on the us diplomatic compound in benghazi\n\nfour americans including ambassador christopher stevens were killed in the benghazi attack which the obama administration initially said was the result of a spontaneous demonstration against an antimuslim video\n\na senior state department counterterrorism official

forces appear to be preparing to intervene in libya to prevent the country from becoming a failed state run by terrorists many with ties to al qaeda\n\nlibya remains an oilrich state and if the country is taken over completely by islamist extremists us counterterrorism officials believe it will become another terrorist safe haven in the region\n\nthe officials said us intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft following the takeover of tripoli international airport in late august and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two libyan stateowned airline companies as security in the country continued to deteriorate amid fighting between islamists and antiislamist militias\n\nvideo surfaced on sunday showing armed fighters from the islamist militia group libyan

missiles antiaircraft guns rocketpropelled grenades shoulderfired antiaircraft missiles assault rifles and armored vehicles the group is closely aligned with al qaedalinked rebels in syria\n\nabderrahmane mekkaoui a moroccan military expert told al jazeera television which first reported the airline theft aug  the alert regarding the stolen jetliners was preventive and covers the region from cairo to lagos nigeria\n\nmekkaoui said the jets are being held by the libyan group called masked men brigade which was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the state

announced aug  two other militia groups known as al qaqa and al sawa controlled the airport and all aircraft belonging to libyan airlines and afriqiyah airways\n\nmekkaoui said credible intelligence reports given to states in the region indicated the masked men brigade is plotting to use the planes in attacks on a maghreb state on the  anniversary\n\ncounterterrorism expert sebastian gorka said that if the theft is confirmed the stolen aircraft could be used in at least two ways\n\nthe first would be how commercial airliners were used on sept   literally turning an innocent mode of mass transit into a superhigh precision guided missile of immense potency said gorka who holds the maj gen charles horner chair at marine corps university in quantico va\n\nthe second tactic could be to use the airframe with its civilian markings as a tool of deception to insert a full payload of armed terrorists into a locale that otherwise is always open to commercial carriers he said\n\nmichael rubin a counterterrorism specialist with the american enterprise institute said commercial jetliners in the hands of terrorists could be formidable weapons\n\nwho needs ballistic missiles when you have passenger planes even empty but loaded up with fuel they can be as devastating rubin said\n\neach plane could if deployed by terrorists to maximum devastating effect represent  civilian casualties\n\namong the potential targets are urban areas and economic targets like saudi arabias oil fields\n\nanyone who has ever flown over saudi arabia at night can see refineries like yanbu lit up like christmas trees against the blackness of the desert rubin said one saudi security officer once told me that they would only have about  seconds to shoot down a hijacked plane from the time it

jay paul co\n\ngoogle inc has cemented a pair of massive real estate deals in sunnyvale and redwood city that boost the companys silicon valley footprint by  million square feet  about the size of the empire state building and enough room for more than  workers\n\neven by google standards the latest transactions are blockbusters in one deal google has agreed to lease all of jay paul cos moffett place a  million square foot office campus currently under construction in sunnyvale its a contender for the largest office lease ever signed in silicon valley and perhaps the state of california\n\nin a separate but no less notable deal mountain viewbased google completed the purchase of six buildings from blackstone group and starwood capital totaling about  square feet at redwood citys pacific shores office park its googles first entry into that city and a potential game changer for that commercial real estate market\n\ngoogle is obviously a very strong company and they are in hyper growth mode said amber schiada director of research for real estate services firm jll\n\nthe deals  both of which i previously reported were in the works  were confirmed by sources close to the transactions google declined to comment for this story blackstone didnt return inquiries jay pauls longtime broker phil mahoney of newmark cornish  carey would only say that moffett place is off the market\n\ngoogles expansion on the peninsula has been the biggest real estate story since the  great recession as the worlds biggest websearch advertising company has bought and leased building after building radiating out from its mountain view headquarters its real estate growth dwarfs even that of cisco systems incs expansion during the s\n\nterms of the latest deals were not disclosed but sources estimated the redwood city sale at around  per square foot or  million that would make it perhaps googles single largest real estate acquisition by footprint and dollar amount ever in silicon valley\n\ni welcome them to our city and i look forward to working with them said redwood city mayor jeffrey gee in an interview this afternoon for a long time i would go around and say redwood city is one of the best kept secrets in the bay area with google and everything going on were not a secret anymore\n\naside from sheer size the deals are notable for several reasons first they showcase googles incredibly ambitious growth plans as the company enters new business sectors such as wearable computing selfdriving cars and robotics  all of which could be huge space users on their own\n\ngoogle has not even moved into much of the space it has leased or bought over the last several years yet the company continues to bank more elbow room for future expansion suggesting it is thinking far down the line in terms of its space needs google counted  employees globally as of sept  according to its most recent quarterly report up  percent  or  googlers  from a year ago\n\nthe transactions also alter the marketplace dynamics in two cities by taking available space off the table schiada noted that moffett place was the largest speculatively built project under construction in silicon valley in redwood citys pacific shores which is more than  percent leased im told google will honor all current tenants leases for now but will evaluate moving into spaces as they become available in the years ahead\n\na big question is what does this leave for tenants schiada said speaking specifically about the moffett place deal it also increases rates because the supply becomes more limited\n\nstill that could actually be a good thing for tenants down the line by pushing developers to build more product she added\n\nthis deal essentially eliminates a significant portion of new development which could prompt more developers to move forward she said\n\njim beeger a veteran broker with colliers international said in the short term the sunnyvale deal could also push tenants back into the market\n\nthe transaction could cause tenants of all sizes to realize they should have more of a sense of urgency in their search for a new site he said moffett place will be difficult to replicate and those who lingered no longer have this option\n\nsethena leiker senior analyst for cushman  wakefields silicon valley office agreed\n\ntheres not a lot of spec development coming she said if you want to take any new space youre going to have to take something thats proposed\n\none result beeger said could be a trickledown effect of growing tenants moving to other areas of santa clara county that have available sites\n\nscore for sunnyvale\n\ngoogles lease at moffett place is a huge win for san franciscobased jay paul co if one thats not entirely unexpected jay paul already leased  square feet to google in sunnyvale at a nearby campus called technology corners making google a natural prospect for the new development\n\nand while google has not yet started moving into technology corners the company has also been growing elsewhere in sunnyvale this year snapping up the old juniper networks headquarters  square feet and former head office of palm computing inc  square feet and its rumored that a fund cbre global investors thats buying up land all around sunnyvales moffett park business district is actually acting on behalf of google\n\nyet landing google wasnt guaranteed when jay paul started building moffett place earlier this year on spec other major tech tenants were also making offers on the property according to sources the rent google is paying isnt known but jay paul was asking  per square foot on a triplenet basis or not including utilities taxes and fees\n\nredwood city action\n\nin redwood city google picks a up a major chunk one of silicon valleys marquee office campuses the building millionsquarefoot project was built by jay paul co in the early s and gained notice for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools a rockclimbing wall day spa and baseball diamonds\n\nstarwood bought the campus in  for about  million and immediately sold two buildings to shorenstein the san franciscobased landlord blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago informatica also acquired two buildings out of the  in  for  per square foot googles acquisition this week is only for the six blackstonestarwood buildings\n\nas i reported earlier this month a new owner could build even more office space at pacific shores new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total buildout of up to  million square feet\n\ngoogle  which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom  may have been attracted to the project partly for its water transit possibilities beyond freeways\n\npacific shores is a half mile from the port of redwood city where a google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from san francisco and alameda to the port\n\nmayor gee said the city would be happy to work with google on such a plan should the search company decide to go in that direction\n\none of the things thats always a challenge with new forms of transportation is is there enough there there he said with google that potentially brings the there there\n\ncheck back later

feet  meters deep outside the international airport serving nicaraguas capital some nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid

impact\n\nthis event was separated by  hours from the close earth approach of  rc so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated says yeomans because the earth moves about  miles  million kilometers in  hours there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nrussian

been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

case it was not done the vaticans deputy spokesman father ciro benedettini said on saturday when asked about how the media ran with the story\n\nthe spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside italy on friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that\n\nreligion news service was among the first media to put the record straight it said in an article published late on friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the italian newspaper corriere della sera on nov  whose headline was misleading\n\nthe article recounted the popes words from his general audience on nov  when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth it cited the remark about animals and attributed it to paul vi but its headline said the pope and animals paradise is open to all creatures\n\nthe new york times which ran a story on thursday about the purported comment by francis acknowledged its mistake saying in a correction on friday that it had misattributed the remark by paul vi to the current pope\n\na spokeswoman for the new york times did not immediately have any comment\n\non its website cnn also corrected its story noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what francis believes about pets going to heaven a spokeswoman for cnn had no immediate comment\n\nreuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to francis\n\nwhat does pope francis think about pets\n\nas for what francis does think about animals he has not spoken much about them in public but benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation\n\nthe spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased\n\nwhen he made a christmas season visit to a rome parish last year francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it the pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs benedettini said\n\nrecent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals\n\nin  pope john

resident in the area of the impact was quoted by the associated press as saying\n\nthe ap quotes nicaraguan government spokeswoman rosario murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to earth\n\nnicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened the ap says\n\nall the evidence that weve confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event ineter scientist jose millan was quoted by the bbc as saying we have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact\n\naccording to the bbc\n\nthe asteroid was discovered on aug  by the catalina sky survey near tucson ariz and independently detected the next night by the panstarrs  telescope located on the summit of haleakala on maui hawaii according to a nasa statement issued last week\n\nthe statement said that on closest approach the asteroid was to have been onetenth the distance from the center of the earth to the moon or about  miles away", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

news australias courier mail newser cosmopolitan uk and several others none have performed any followup to confirm the original reporting one newspaper though added details to the story that were never reported\n\nbut were getting ahead of ourselves lets start with the underlying original story\n\neven in bosnia such a culturally incendiary story should have resulted in local politicians and neerdowells jumping in front of a camera and copious broll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school students from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina went to a fiveday trip and after some time it turned out that seven schoolgirls got pregnant on it\n\nhe said that the reason for this was neglect of parents but also educational institutions toward the education of children\n\nbabic said that early engagement in sexual relations later leads to a series of consequences such as infertility various diseases miscarriages and premature births\n\nin the republika srpska between  to  percent of people are struggling with infertility we have  percent of miscarriages and between  to  percent premature births he said\n\nonly last year according to the clinical center of the university in sarajevo  minors gave birth four of them are  years old ten are  years old and  are  years old\n\nlook at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were active and about to ovulate eitheror\n\nevery scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage to a linkseeking media searching for a scoop this is where we are expected to either get to work debunking the article or to stay clear so how did our brethren respond\n\nat the start of the post i mentioned that the original article has been linked with confirmation of the original reporting by such mainstream newspapers magazines and websites as the new york post the london daily mail the new york daily news the australian courier

named thomas  and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it thomas walks right into a liquor store but instead of alcohol the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck apparently moved by the selfless act lin confronts thomas and tells him that hes being filmed\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nas of tuesday morning the video had racked up more than  million views on youtube and inspired more than  glowing news articles from around the world following its success lin launched an indiegogo fundraising campaign to help thomas get a fresh start which has netted more than  in wellmeaning donations from the public\n\nbut now a nursing student from anaheim has come forward to say theres no way thomas could have been secretly filmedbecause he and lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car the whole thing is bullshit says taugan tan kadalim who claims that on dec  he was outside the euclid liquor  market where the videos pivotal scene is set thomas knew he was being followed\n\nthe yearold says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street as he was walking out of the liquor store kadalim says he spotted lin sitting in the drivers seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos i was like oh my god its him says kadalim adding that he subscribed to lins youtube channel i couldnt believe it\n\na cameraman sat in the passenger seat of lins car and behind him was the man who kadalim would later recognize as thomas the homeless samaritan lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video kadalim decided to stick around and watch\n\nwhat kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video\n\nyoutube\n\naccording to kadalim lin hopped out of the car went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier while the two men chatted inside thomas waited with his bag by lins car eventually the prankster returned to his car and a few minutes later thomas wandered into the liquor store several calls to euclid liquor  market to confirm kadalims account went unanswered\n\nthat was the last thing i remember seeing kadalim says\n\nin the actual video thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks and as he enters the store lin says to his cameraman keep filming make sure he doesnt see you\n\nkadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother a fellow youtube prank enthusiast he shared the text with vocativ and the date and time stamps appear to match up kadalims girlfriend who spoke on the condition that we not use her name also corroborates the account\n\nhe told me that he had just run into some famous youtube star while buying a lotto ticket she tells vocativ don couldnt wait to watch the video\n\nbut when kadalim did see the video released on dec  he was floored\n\nbro he drove thomas to the liquor store he says while i think the guy is homeless it is clear that from what i saw every part of that scene was staged\n\nupset kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video\n\nim not frustrated because hes helping a homeless man and people love this video he says im frustrated because its dishonest and exploitive\n\nprior to kadalims revelation lin told vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted there is no way were making any of this up he said this is real\n\nsubsequent attempts to reach lin for further comment on kadalims accusations were unsuccessful\n\nafter the video went viral lin told us previously that he plucked thomas from the homeless shelter where hed been staying and put him up in a hotel the name of which lin would not disclose lin has also refused all media requests to speak with thomas and he denied repeated requests from vocativ to make thomas available for an interview at the same time hes been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man including this xmas surprise makeover released sunday\n\nuploaded by joshpalerlin\n\nlin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works in which he plans to surprise thomas with all of the money thats been raised for him on indiegogo asked how the public could be

moment on a rainy november day and the setting in st peters square only burnished francis reputation as a kindly peoples pope the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york times\n\ntheres only one problem apparently none of it ever happened\n\nyes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years ago\n\nthe story was titled somewhat misleadingly paradise for animals the pope doesnt rule it out it wasnt clear which pope the writer meant however\n\nthe next day nov  a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline further the pope and pets paradise is open to all creatures\n\nvecchi faithfully recounted the popes talk about a new creation and also cited paul vis remark\n\nbut the headline put those words in francis mouth and that became the story\n\nthe italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying we will go to heaven with the animals and contending that the pope was quoting st paul  not pope paul  as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog that story by the way is nowhere in the bible\n\nthe urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited st paul as saying that one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ while it has francis adding the phrase paradise is open to all gods creatures\n\nfueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cows milk  and francis said his own mother gave him donkeys milk as a baby\n\nsocial media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the chronology it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological

caption\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis\nwhen the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea has never crossed my mind and that depicting the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to

it could be a small insect bite\nso according to the doctors over here ive come down with some mystery condition he said in a facebook post on oct  that included a photo of the scar tad scary\nlater that day thomas posted another photo that showed the scar beginning to ooze\nit was a searing burn he said\nturns out it was a matchheadsized tropical spider that had burrowed into thomas skin through his scar from when his appendix was removed recently\nwell after running tests and putting things inside my stomach they finally found out it was a tropical spider thats been living inside of me for the last  days managed to get it out luckily thomas wrote in a followup facebook post showing off his freshly bandaged scar havent felt so violated in my life before just glad its all over\nwhile the experience literally got under his skin thomas has remained in good spirits throughout the ordeal if his facebook posts are any indication\nstill hoping im going to develop superpowers by the time im

skin\nmr thomas said a specialist dermatologist later used tweezers to remove what was believed to be a tropical spider\nadvertisement  \nbut it seems we may have all been caught in a web of misinformation\narachnologist dr volker framenau said whatever the creature was it was almost impossible for the culprit to have been a spider\nif you look at a spider the fangs the mouth parts they have they are not able to burrow they cant get through skin he said\nwe thought it may have been something like a mite there are a few different parasitic mites out there which can sometimes look a bit like a spider i cant think of any spider which could do this to a person\ndr mark harvey from the western australian museum agreed and said he found the case bizarre\ni must confess i was amazed because ive never heard of a spider being able to survive under the skin of a human or indeed any mammal he said\nspiders need air to breathe they have spiracles on the sides of their bodies where air comes into their system through a series of what we call book lungs being under the skin of somebody i would have thought they wouldnt have enough air to survive\neven if it was a mite ive never seen anything like this even if it was an insect ive never heard of an insect crawling under the skin like this so it really is a remarkable case\ndr harvey said spiders were widely feared in the community and often were the subject of urban legends\nwe hear about people going on holidays and having spiders lay eggs under the skin then the baby spiders burst out when they return from their holiday in the tropics he said\nnone of those are true theyre just made up stories\ntheyre not actually able to dig through the skin thats why this case is so unusual some can burrow into soil but they have to remove soil particles one at a time if they want to do that\nsomething which is true according to dr harvey is that certain arachnids do live on humans\nwe all have mites living on our faces theyre follicle mites but theyre absolutely miniscule and you cant see them we transmit them to our children when we have kids he said\nthey live in the bases of hair follicles on our faces and in some of the pores in our skin those mites are so small you cant see them and theyre not going to cause a blemish on the skin like this lad has on his stomach\ndr framenau said that much of the confusion could be eliminated by keeping or catching the creepy crawly offender dead or alive and enlisting the help of experts\nit would be great if they collected it or took a photo of it he said\nif you have been bitten by something the best thing you can do is collect it and submit it to a museum for identification before these things go viral\ndylan thomas has been contacted for comment", "label":

we received word that around am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of bankys art studios this group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred we then arrested the group  men total these individuals all had id on them except for one and that is the one we believed to be banksy edwards said we then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism we also found a passport and id of a paul horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding edwards continued horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism conspiracy racketeering and counterfeiting we are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time\n\nhorner was arrested by london police in watford a town and borough in hertfordshire england about  miles northwest of central london\n\nthe graffiti artist that goes by the name space invader told reporters he does not agree with the arrest or outing of banksys identity\n\nhes just doing art spreading joy and making political statements the best way he knows how that is what he was doing and i hope that is what hell continue to do invader said for the london police to setup some hour task force just to catch banksy is ridiculous i hope we hear plenty of noise from the good taxpaying citizens of london about this\n\nafter todays arrest it is unclear who else will be sought in connection with banksys arrest cnn spoke with john hawes who is a project manager for banksy says he is worried that charges could be brought against him also\n\nif they spent this many manhours and brought this many charges against banksy i cant imagine that hell be the only one to go down in all of this hawes said all the beauty paul horner brought to this world unfortunately the london police just see it as vandalism and want to lock him up its such a shame\n\nbanksys identity was long speculated to be robin gunningham a man born in bristol england in  known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces he does not sell his work directly however art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder\n\npolice apprehended the famous street artist while in the middle of finishing a piece about a mascot for a christian organization named fappy the antimasturbation dolphin\n\nim just happy to be a part of this whole thing fappy told cnn im not familiar with this banksy character honestly if its not in the bible i probably havent heard of it but if this arrest spreads awareness of the harmful effects of selfrape then that is a good thing hopefully news of this ordeal will bring the much needed attention to the dangers and consequences of playing with your sin stick or ringing the devils doorbell hopefully god willing one day masturbation will be illegal and people will finally be free of playing on the devils playground\n\nlocal resident year old matthew williams told reporters he was disgusted when he heard news of the arrest\n\nwhat a waste of taxpayers money wouldnt it be better spent fighting the war against drugs or violence  what harm has this man done except produce beautiful thought provoking artwork the counterfeit money thing has either been planted or its part if his art and not actual real counterfeit cash williams continued this is just another move by the fiveoh to crush anything good and free people need to work out what side theyre on and if theyre on the side of beauty and freedom they need to start fighting back there are simply not enough heroes like banksy to do it for you i hope this blows up in the cops faces and the rest of the government as well\n\npeople are taking the

have been presented no doctors involved in treating the patient have been quoted and no witnesses to the spider removal other than dylan thomas himself have been referenced\n\nperhaps theres a germ of

apple critics have always roasted the company for selling products that are more expensive than they should be and they frequently use this as a wedge topic to criticize buyers but the karat gold apple watch edition will set a whole new bar with a sales price of  the funny thing in this case is that apple is perfectly right to be charging that much\n\ndo you disagree check out my counterpoint the case against the  gold apple watch edition\n\ngold is expensive\n\nlets start with a little backgrounder in gold everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive even rabid internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news but most people dont understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is so this is a good place to begin the discussion\n\nupdate my calculations were wrong also this was a bit back of the envelope now that it has some readership i realize i should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic\n\nhere are the basic facts\n\ngold currently sells for between  and  per troy ounce and has been over  per troy ounce for the last five years\nkarat gold contains  pure gold and that term is regulated by law\none ounce of k gold occupies about  cubic centimeters of volume since a typical karat gold alloy weighs about  grams per cc\nkarat gold currently sells for  per gram  per troy ounce or  per cc\n cc of k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and  cc gets you a deployant clasp it takes a few more to build a watch case anywhere from  to  cc depending on the size and thickness of the case so the buckle is worth  and the watch case  to  just as raw gold this is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than \n\ngold watches are expensive\n\nlets apply this to a watch case imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case  mm high by  mm wide by  mm deep if it was solid this would equal  cc of volume but its a watch case so you have to leave room for the movement dial case back etc so lets just leave  mm of thickness all around making a hollow rectangle this equals  cc  x  x    x  x  therefore the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost  as of this writing\n\na simple xx mm rectangle of  mm thick karat gold would cost over \na simple xx mm rectangle of  mm thick karat gold would cost more than \nnow lets consider the same shape but just  mm thick thats  cc of gold worth  pick your thickness and youre still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold\n\nhow does this translate in the real world lets look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and karat gold\n\nthis cartier tank mc is  more in k gold\nthis cartier tank mc is  more in k gold\nthe cartier tank mc measures  mm by  mm by  mm thick  extra list for k gold\ncartier tank mc in stainless steel  list  street\ncartier tank mc in k pink gold  list  street\nthe jaegerlecoultre reverso squadra hometime measures  mm by  mm by  mm thick  extra list for k gold\njaegerlecoultre reverso squadra hometime in stainless steel  list  street\njaegerlecoultre reverso squadra hometime in k pink gold  list  street\nthis list could go on and on but the gist is simple karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel in fact its pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under  in any size and from any manufacturer even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny chopard happy sport mini sells for  most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either karat or less very slim and small or long out of production and with outdated pricing\n\nthen theres the bracelet swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra  adding a gold bracelet to that jaegerlecoultre bumps the price to \n\ncertainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case and the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities there are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold and plenty of reserves so no company no matter how strong can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers\n\nanother reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility they cant price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long so they generally price somewhat higher than they would even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials labor distribution and profit in a watch\n\nthe apple watch edition will cost \n\ntheres a reason i picked those two watches for my comparisons both are similar in size and shape to the  mm apple watch the cartier is a little smaller and the jaegerlecoultre is a little larger but both represent a traditional watchmakers goldcased squareish offering in the space and both cost more than  with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle and jony ive recently said that the historic cartier tank was one of his inspirations for the apple watch design\n\napple would be crazy to sell the apple watch edition for  though thats not going to happen so theyre likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically\n\nfirst as we can see the apple watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions although questionable from an esthetic standpoint this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot second apple watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display sensors and such third the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum not gold to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions\n\ncould it be gold plated no numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case although apple has not apparently used the word solid in their press releases they do claim it is crafted from karat gold and nowhere does it say it is plated or gold filled the industry term there are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and apple cannot break these any more than tiffany could\n\napple says that the apple watch will start at  for that aluminum sport model and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel apple watch to be roughly  it is reasonable to assume that the gold edition model will sell for substantially more than this with many suggesting  or  but remember that this price would only cover  or  ounces of gold even with thin walls and a steel frame its hard to see how apple could make a solid karat gold case and buckle for a  mm watch with just  ounces of gold\n\ngold is soft but apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as standard gold taking that at face value perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch this still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case the apple watch edition will come in  mm and  mm sizes a difference of about  in terms of case volume so the smaller model could sell for  less still\n\nmy prediction is that the  mm apple watch edition will retail for  with the  mm apple watch edition retailing for  this covers the cost of the gold case the internals manufacturing sales and profit and yet does not leave apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a toothin or plated case i will be shocked if the price is  but i suppose its possible with some finagling and if thats the smaller model and it will not be any less than that\n\nthis is a  product\nthis is a  product\nbonus prediction given the very high price of the apple watch edition i predict that availability will be quite limited apple will likely create special storewithinastore spaces in certain apple store locations for the edition i further expect them to open special standalone apple edition boutiques to sell the watch edition accessories and perhaps other future highend products\n\nupdate\n\nneedless to say many people disagree with me and now that @gruber fireballed this post i imagine ill hear from lots of them real soon\n\nthe gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case i assumed it would be quite thick read sturdy and would contain upwards of  grams of k gold then theres the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams but @gakpdx  and others though he was most visually eloquent suspects it contains much less gold\n\n\ni think this number is way too low but its a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow and it puts the raw gold at about  at  per gram of k gold although this is admittedly much much lower than my estimate it still illustrates my point that the apple watch edition is not going to be cheap and i think hes way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong\n\nanother argument is based on this  analysis of a gold rolex watch right off the bat one should point out that gold cost oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well something apple is apparently not going to do with the edition that rolex case contained  grams of gold alloy but its much much smaller than the apple watch and its circular to boot a mm circle is mm in circumference while the mm apple watch is mm in circumference use the magic of math to scale the rolex up into a mm rectangle and were at  grams but that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel and the apple watch is pretty slabsided so we can probably double this safely and come out with  of gold in my mangled square rolex case\n\nso there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold i can accept that but lets take a step back and think about the final price even if it contained less than  of gold how much would it sell for certainly not  or  you still have to account for the cost of everything else plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution and profit for apple and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold so were back at the  estimate others have made as greg koenig tweeted and forbes reported if anyone thinks apple is charging less than k for the edition they are smoking crack\n\nregardless of the total its important to realize that the price of gold is in the drivers seat when it comes to pricing the apple watch edition\n\nid love to be wrong and i look forward to updating this piece thanks for reading", "label": "agree"}]}

according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

{"claim": "Nicaragua Meteorite Impact Theory May Be Meteorwrong", "perspectives": [{"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video

assistance from international scientists including those from the united states to investigate\n\nthe composition of the meteorite has yet to be determined and it was not clear if it had disintegrated on hitting the ground or been buried under the ground\n\nwilfredo strauss of the nicaraguan institute of earth studies said we are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact\n\nyou can see two waves on the seismic equipment first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nrosario murillo

linked with the asteroid  rc which flew by earth raises some interesting questions\n\nalthough the impact occurred roughly  hours before the asteroid passed earth that part of the planet was facing in the right direction for it to have been a fragment associated with it\n\nif it was an unrelated object however then it further demonstrates how we dont really monitor all the potentially dangerous rocks out there", "label": "agree"}, {"text": "update the story has been updated to reflect new evidence and analysis from experts news has been circulating about a potential meteorite strike near managua nicaragua late saturday night just  hours or so before the close flyby of m asteroid  rc leading some to suggest that the two events are related however according to experts who have been examining the evidence including those at nasa the two events are completely unrelated and the explosion in managua may have nothing to do with objects falling from space\n\naccording to the nicaraguan news site eldigitalcom an explosion occurred around  pm saturday night in the city of managua which apparently produced a crater that was over  metres  feet wide and about  metres  feet deep in a wooded area just to the west of the citys international airport and just south of the panamerican highway\n\nthe video below from rtcom shows military personnel investigating the crater as well as the surrounding area for potential debris from the explosion\nwhile the incident is still being investigated officials with nicaraguas institute of territorial studies inet which monitors earthquake activity in the country said that the event showed up on the agencys seismic instruments\n\nwe are convinced that this was a meteorite we have seen the crater from the impact wilfried strauch from inet said in a press conference according to agence francepresse afp you can see two waves first a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth and then another stronger one which is the impact of the sound\n\nhowever while there have been reports of people hearing the explosion the scientists have the seismic data from it and they have the resulting crater there are parts of the story that just dont add up\n\na metre wide asteroid named  rc passed by earth on sunday flying underneath the planet from the perspective of someone in the northern hemisphere and while there is roughly a hour difference in the timing of these two events some saw a potential connection between these events its not entirely unreasonable to suggest this there are over  known nearearth asteroids flying around the sun and very likely millions that we havent detected and likely wont because theyre too small while most of these follow their own path as they circle the sun not all are alone some asteroids have tiny moons orbiting them some are best described as rubble piles which are groups of smaller objects only barely held together into a boulderlike shape by their mutual gravity others can be travelling along in packs with some members preceding or lagging behind the pack leader  possibly due to an impact with another meteoroid or asteroid at some point so if one of these asteroid packs is flying by or an asteroid that still has debris from a past impact travelling along the same orbit it is possible that one piece could strike the atmosphere and survive to hit the ground\n\nhowever just because two events  an asteroid flyby and a meteorite impact  happen close to one another doesnt mean that they are related we saw this back in midfebruary  when we were watching asteroid  da sweep by earth and suddenly a m wide asteroid exploded over chelyabinsk russia the exact timing and traced orbits of these two objects quickly showed that they were completely separate objects and the timing was a just coincidence \n\naccording to nasas jet propulsion laboratory near earth object office that appears to be the case for this event\na meteorite without the meteor\n\nan interesting fact about this supposed impact is that although the explosion was heard throughout the area apparently nobody witnessed any bright light associated with it when a meteoroid enters the atmosphere even if it is just a speck of dust it is traveling so fast typically around  kilometres per second or over  kmh that it heats up the air in front of it causing the air to glow brightly and produce the streak of light in the sky we call a meteor larger objects cause even brighter flashes earning them the name fireballor even bolide for an exceptionally large and bright one some of these are so bright that they can very briefly turn night into day as they pass overhead\n\ngiven the weather over managua on saturday night scattered clouds and calm winds it would have been very difficult to miss such a fireball or bolide lighting up their night sky especially when it happened near a city of over  million people\n\naccording to the associated press strauch said it was very strange that no one reported a streak of light we have to ask if anyone has a photo or something\n\nwas it something else\n\nthis lack of a fireball is a sticking point in the story while nearly all meteorites go through a dark flight phase during the final part of their journey to earths surface  after it has slowed down enough that it isnt compressing the air enough to cause it to glow  their fireball or bolide stage happens far up in the atmosphere some  to  kilometres above the ground making them visible far and wide across the countryside\n\ngeoff nodkin professional meteorite hunter and host of science channels meteorite men tweeted his thoughts about the possibility of this being authentic\nnotkin further commented that if it was meteoriterelated he would expect there to be a very bright fireball sonic booms during the objects dark flight and then the impact he also said that to produce a crater like the one seen it would have to be an iron meteorite as they are the densest and have formed the majority of known meteorite craters on earth\n\nin an interview with national geographic donald yeomans the author of nearearth objects finding them before they find us said there was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion so it seems unlikely that the explosion in nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact\n\nso what was this if it wasnt a meteorite one very real possibility is that it was a landmine explosion as there are still thousandsin cas buried throughout the country remnants of the war fought there in the s\n\nwhile this particular event is looking more and more like a false alarm with time it should be noted that fireballs blaze through our skies every day as tons of material is swept up by earth as the planet orbits the sun many of these are missed because they occur during the day or over regions of the planet that arent heavily populated some countries have allsky camera networks to capture these events with data being reported on sites like spaceweathercom us and the university of western ontario canada as an example there was a bright fireball that occurred just before this explosion in managua but it happened thousands of kilometres away across the atlantic ocean over eastern spain as shown in this animation taken from railway camera video note what appears to be a second object that may be a piece breaking off the primary one", "label": "disagree"}]}

neerdowells jumping in front of a camera and copious broll of the schools front entrance none of this is present the only source referenced at all in the story is babici and his claim that it happened but notably he is not quoted as saying it happened  he is paraphrased the remainder of the article does include a direct quote from him but the quote doesnt refer to the incident it instead pushes what is likely a top agenda of his ministry which is that teenage sexual activity can have other health consequences and that curbing teen sex is the responsibility of both the parent and the school\n\nnational coordinator for reproductive health of the republika srpska nenad babici said that children engage in sexual relations as early as at age of  or  and added that primary school

at that last paragraph if a city the size of sarajevo only recorded  instances of teenage births last year then sarajevo doesnt have a teen pregnancy problem unless the rate of teen pregnancies that are aborted is stratospheric\n\nmeanwhile this story claims the girls were visiting sarajevo from a small town in bosnia and herzegovina called banja luka it is not at all clear as to what population that  minors is drawn from\n\nbeyond the shortcomings of the article itself how likely is the storys claim\n\nstatistics on the percentages of unprotected sexual encounters that result in pregnancy are not wonderful for obvious reasons this study referenced in this bbc article puts the figure at about  percent except for the short window prior to ovulation during which the study estimates the odds at  percent so either the seven children were ovulating at the same time and had about four encounters each or they each had closer to  encounters over the five days\n\nor all  students were active and about to ovulate eitheror\n\nevery scenario presented by this article seems absurdly improbable from the incident itself to the manner of the coverage to a linkseeking media searching for a

happened as the video started to go viral just before christmas he posted a comment to lins youtube channel explaining what he witnessed his words however were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of

peters square only burnished francis reputation as a kindly peoples pope the story naturally lit up social media became instant promotional material for vegetarians and animal rights groups and on friday even made it to the front page of the new york times\n\ntheres only one problem apparently none of it ever happened\n\nyes a version of that quotation was uttered by a pope but it was said decades ago by paul vi who died in  there is no evidence that francis repeated the words during his public audience on nov  as has been widely reported nor was there was a boy mourning his dead dog\n\nso how could such a fable so quickly become taken as fact\n\npart of the answer may be the topic of the popes talk to the crowd that day which centered on the end times and the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth citing st paul in the new testament francis said that is not the annihilation of the cosmos and of everything around us but the bringing of all things into the fullness of being\n\nthe trail of digital bread crumbs then appears to lead to an italian news report that extended francis discussion of a renewed creation to the question of whether animals too will go to heaven\n\none day we will see our pets in the eternity of christ the report quoted paul vi as telling a disconsolate boy years ago\n\nthe story was titled somewhat misleadingly paradise for animals the pope doesnt rule it out it wasnt clear which pope the writer meant however\n\nthe next day nov  a story in the italian daily corriere della sera by veteran vaticanista gian guido vecchi pushed the headline further the pope and pets paradise is open to all creatures\n\nvecchi faithfully recounted the popes talk about a new creation and also cited paul vis remark\n\nbut the headline put those words in francis mouth and that became the story\n\nthe italian version of the huffington post picked it up next and ran an article quoting francis as saying we will go to heaven with the animals and contending that the pope was quoting st paul  not pope paul  as making that statement to console a boy who lost his dog that story by the way is nowhere in the bible\n\nthe urban legend became unstoppable a week later when it was translated into english and picked up by the british press which cited st paul as saying that one day we will see our animals again in the eternity of christ while it has francis adding the phrase paradise is open to all gods creatures\n\nfueling the meme was the fact that francis was photographed accepting a gift of two donkeys from a company promoting the use of donkey milk for infants allergic to cows milk  and francis said his own mother gave him donkeys milk as a baby\n\nsocial media and other media outlets then picked up the story further conflating the statements and the chronology it became a hot mess of a story that was also sparking another theological debate by a pope who was known for prompting controversy\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis \n show caption\n\nthe new york times was the biggest of several outlets relating an apparently apocryphal tale about pets paradise and pope francis\nwhen the new york times went with the story along with input from ethicists and theologians it became gospel truth\n\ntelevision programs discussed the popes theological breakthrough news outlets created photo galleries of popes with cute animals and others used it as a jumping off point to discuss what other religions think about animals and the afterlife at america magazine the rev james martin wrote an essay discussing the theological implications of francis statements and what level of authority they may have it was all very interesting and illuminating but based on a misunderstanding\n\na number of factors probably contributed to this journalistic train wreck\n\nthe story had so much going for it francis took his papal name from st francis of assisi the patron saint of environmentalism who famously greeted animals as brothers and sisters\npope francis is also preparing a major teaching document on the environment and almost since the day he was elected in  he has stressed the christian duty to care for creation\nfrancis also blessed a blind mans guide dog shortly after he was elected an affecting image that was often used in connection with these latest reports of his concern for animals\nmoreover the media and the public are so primed for francis to say novel things and disregard staid customs that the story was too good to check out it fit with the pattern\nin most accounts francis comments were also set against statements by his predecessor benedict xvi who insisted that animals did not have souls that apparent contrast fit a common narrative pitting the more conservative benedict against the ostensibly liberal francis\n\nthat may be true in some areas but probably not when it comes to animals\n\nadding insult to injury the times article cited st john paul ii as saying in  that animals have souls and are as near to god as men are but that too was a misquote as media critic dawn eden explained at the website getreligion\n\non the other hand there should have been warnings signs francis has frowned at the modern tendency to favor pets over people and he has criticized the vast amounts of money spent by wealthy societies on animals even as children go hungry\n\nin addition the popes huge popularity has led to at least one other instance of mythmaking news reports last year said that francis was sneaking out of the vatican at night to feed the homeless around rome\n\nthe pope personally debunked that rumor in an interview last march saying the idea has never crossed my mind and that depicting the pope to be a sort of superman a type of star seems offensive to me\n\nmaybe hell have to give another interview to deflate this latest story and to offer
